While daily journaling may seem like a time-consuming rocket science of a thing, well guess what? It is not. Journaling can be as simple as making a list or writing your favorite quote or as complicated as creating a portrait or drafting a mind map. 
People who journal daily have a lot of different ways to journal. Some of them use the journals to plan their day, some use them to gather their thoughts on a specific idea. Your daily journal is your personal space and you can write, draw, and decorate it the way you want. There are no hard rules when it comes to journaling. You just need to be passionate and willing to dedicate some time to a pen and a paper. Let’s find out all about daily journaling. 

# Why You Should Journal Daily

Daily journaling or just writing your thoughts on paper can go a long way.  Some researchers have even observed that it can heal wounds faster. Seems like a long shot? Well! keep reading, because the truth is yet to behold).

## Relieve stress

Writing down your thoughts and feelings when you are feeling stress can lighten the emotional baggage from your mind. It makes your mind calmer and relaxed by letting you vent out. 

## Improve your writing skills

Writing your thoughts, in general, can improve your writing skills, especially if you are trying to learn a new language or simply trying to strengthen the language you already know. Start writing in that language and you will be able to see where you make mistakes and can improve them. Daily journaling also improves your expression.

## Improve memory

Writing about your daily stuff in your journal makes you remember things for a longer period. And you can always go back to what you wrote and freshen your memory of the specific event. If you write your journal in the morning, you can also write down your dreams to better remember them as we tend to forget them once we get busy in daily routines.

## Enables decision making

People who have the habit of journaling have better decision-making abilities. Writing down the pros and cons of a specific decision can help you step back from the emotions and evaluate the risks associated with that decision.

## Record of life events

Daily journaling helps you record your life. You can always look back on the specific events and your feelings about them (Don’t forget to put dates on your journal to look back in the future when you experienced this specific event) This can also be a legacy for the younger generations (If you decide to share with them).

## Better planning

Daily journaling can help you plan your day by making to-do lists. You can also plan other things like an event or a wedding by writing it in your journal. This way you won’t forget important stuff and can check and recheck if you made the required appointments.

## Improves creativity

If you are a creative artist, you can always show your creativity in your journals. Practice will make your skills better every day and you will be able to track your performance by looking at those sketches.

# Can Daily Journaling be a Problem

Writing every day is not a cup of tea for everyone. Is that so? Well! not really, only if you do it properly. It can lead to burnout, self-criticism, and over-analysis of one’s self. If you are feeling burnt out or any of those signs, take a break, and do something else fun. Get your thoughts together while doing what you love, and then come back to journaling at your own pace. You may need to consider journaling on alternative days or twice a week.
