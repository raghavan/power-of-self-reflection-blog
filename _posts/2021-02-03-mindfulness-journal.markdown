# Mindfulness Journal

Mindfulness originates from the Eastern world, often being attributed to Buddhism. These practises have transformed and grown into an exercise that is beyond one specific religion. Mindfulness is a healthy practise for everyone. Children, teenagers, adults and seniors all benefit from the stress reducing impact of mindfulness. The beauty of mindfulness is that it can literally be done anywhere and you experience the results immediately.

When you experience mindfulness your mind;
-   opens to creativity
-   your heart calms down your body into a healthier state
-   your nerves relax
-   and the anxiety you feel dissipates.

## Where to Practice Mindfulness
Mindfulness can be practiced at home, in your office or in your car on a break. It can be done at any time of day. You begin your day by releasing your worries and you create space for a deeper sleep with mindfulness.

## How to Practice Mindfulness

The practice of mindfulness can happen through a variety of disciplines. Your practise of mindfulness could be sitting in stillness, listening to calming music and bringing attention to your breath. In this article we will look at the connection of journaling and mindfulness.

## Journaling and Mindfulness

Journaling is one way to create stillness in your mind. When you are struggling to calm your mind, writing your thoughts and pressures down is one way to let them rest for a while. They will not be forgotten, and your mind can have a break from the busyness they create.

Mindfulness and journaling together create a space that is safe and open. In mindfulness you are asked to observe your thoughts but not engage with them. Journaling allows you to pause, notice and then release. This clears your mind and allows you to be mindfully in the present moment.

The next time you have a few moments to yourself and wish to discover more self awareness pick up your journal. Your journal can always be available to you thanks to the latest technology and such applications as Neolama. You no longer need to have a physical book with you when you feel inspired to write.

## Journaling and Stress Relief

Writing in your journal allows a free flow of unquestioned answers to emerge. It is a great way to experience your authentic self. This establishes more self connection. It can be a ‘reality check’ as to what is causing you stress or what questions you need answered. You may need to write for a while and then step away for contemplation.

On the other hand, you may get into the flow and feel like you need limitless pages for all that is coming forward. Great questions to start with are ones that feel comfortable and positive. An example could be what excites you? When did you experience joy recently? What do you look forward to? In time a journal will become a vessel for self reflection and understanding. There could not be a nicer gift to yourself.

When you are struggling to fall asleep, writing out your thoughts can be the release your brain needs to settle into rest. When you are having a hard time making a decision, journaling your choices and worries will open your mind to a right outcome.

##  Celebrities on Mindfulness

Hugh Jackman was quoted as saying
> In meditation, I can let go of everything. I’m not Hugh Jackman. I’m not a Dad. I’m not a husband. I’m just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything. I take a little bath in it.

Tina Turner said 
>Meditation and praying changes your spirit into something positive.

 Mindfulness through journaling will change your life. You will experience an opening to a rich and wonderful world you always had inside. Pick up your tablet and just start writing, you won’t turn back I promise.
