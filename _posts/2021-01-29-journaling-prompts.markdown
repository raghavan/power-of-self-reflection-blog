Kids:
What is your favourite day of the week and why?
If you could keep only one form of technology what would you choose?
Describe your favourite Holiday.
If you could keep only 20 words of your language, which words would you keep.
If you could be an animal, which one would you be and why?
 
Teens:
If there was one place you could travel to today, where would you go?
If you could invent something for the world, what problem/issue would you fix?
What is your happiest memory?
Where do you feel most at peace in your life?
If you could predict one thing that will be different in 2050, what would it be?
 
Adults:
When did you last laugh and what were you doing?
If you could describe yourself, without listing your job, what would you say?
What do you love about life?
Name your favourite book you have read recently and describe what it was you loved?
If you could escape for a day, where would you go? What would you do? How would you feel?
