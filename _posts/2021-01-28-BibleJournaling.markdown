# Bible Journaling

You are here because you may be intrigued by the idea of Bible journaling or you want to enhance your skills at it. No doubt, Bible journaling is a creative way of understanding, reflecting, remembering, and making the Bible scriptures special for yourself.
And if you love art, what could be a better and creative way to demonstrate your understanding and feelings about a specific Scripture and make a special bond with it. If you want to know more about Bible Journaling, stay tuned, as this article is going to be an ultimate primer for you.

## Is Bible Journaling Disrespecting?

If you are worried about Bible journaling being disrespectful, you are not alone. There are strong opinions about Bible journaling. Some think that Bible journaling is disrespectful to God’s word as you are writing and drawing directly on the bible. While others believe otherwise. If you are skeptical of the idea of Bible journaling and fascinated by it at the same time, the best way to deal is to ask your trusted pastor and follow your heart. 
Bible journaling is an extremely personal and private matter. If you do not feel comfortable writing or drawing on the Bible itself, another way is to write and draw on a separate page or post-it notes. You can then paste these notes on or around the verse in your bible. This will help you get the benefits of Bible journaling while keeping your Bible clean at the same time.

## Why You Should Do Bible Journaling?

All that hype for Bible Journaling is for real because it offers you many benefits. If you don’t know why you should do Bible journaling, have a look at the following benefits:

- Bible Journaling slows down your speed of reading a passage that you otherwise read quickly, close the Bible and get on with your daily activities. And then you forget instantly. When you take time to read, reflect, write or draw, you take time to understand it. This also helps you remember it.

- Bible journaling helps you reflect on a specific Scripture. When you read a Scripture and reflect on it, you connect it with your feelings and experiences in your daily life. You can relate messages in the Scriptures to what you should do in your life. 

- Highlighting the Scriptures, writing notes or drawing helps to keep a record. And you can rediscover yourself when you read it after some time.  

- You can also use Bible Journaling to remember the history of each Scripture or write notes to better understand the Scriptures. This way you won’t have to consult any other source.

## How To Start Journaling?

Below are some creative ways you can stay organized, and make the Bible reading more meaningful. 

##Select a Bible:

The first thing you need is, of course, a Bible. While there is a variety of Bibles available in the market, you can use any Bible of your choice. Consider a Bible with bigger words as it's easy to read. Similarly, some Bibles have extra-wide margins of 2 inches that give you enough room to do the artwork. 
Opt for the ones with thicker pages if you are planning to use ink pens or watercolors as the colors or inks can bleed out to other pages if the paper is thin. So the selection of the Bible also depends on your artwork. 


## Take a Verse That Touches Your Heart:

The best way to start is to choose a Scripture that is close to your heart. Think about how it makes you feel and by thinking, it means to take your time and think hard.
Think about a special moment when you were in the dark but God showed you light. Or remember when you thought things would never get better but then you read a Scripture that gave you hope and motivation. Get inspired by your thoughts and reflect on them on the paper.

## Highlight:

Some people, when they want to emphasize a verse or want to make notes of it, use highlighters to highlight the words. This is the simplest way to mark the words that stand out to you. You can use any type of color you like.

## Take Notes:
If you don’t want to write on the Bible, post-it notes are for you. Write or draw anything you want on the post-it notes and paste for the future to look back at.

## Draw With Pencils:
When it comes to drawing, a pencil is your best friend. As it gives you the room to make mistakes, erase your drawing, improve it or simply start your drawing again.

## Outline With Pen:
You can use pens to outline your drawings and shapes and also for calligraphy or anything else you want to include in your journaling process.
